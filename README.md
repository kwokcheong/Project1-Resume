This is my resume done up in a website, aimed towards providing my prospective employers with a unique and interactive resume viewing experience. The website contains various visual elements that highlights my current skillsets, educational background and portfolio - ```A video showcase of my past work experience, list of my coding experience, skills and passion, recent works, contact me section and infographic on my hobbies. ```

## UX
My goal in the design is to ensure that viewers have direct access to information they are looking for, which is arranged in bite-sized containers so that it is both simple and enjoyable to digest. Starting with a video at the header, it serves to grab the attention of the viewers within a 6 seconds time frame so as to incite them to want to find out more. The use of calm, matte color palatte allowed the visual elements in the website take the spotlight, hence preventing a contest for user attention and reducing the overall noise in the website.

I adopted a user-centric approach to my design, positioning the website in a single scrolling order such that it addresses the overlying questions an employer would have while scrolling down my resume. And if employers are interested in reaching out to me, they can do so by either clicking on the contact button on the navigation bar or by selecting any social media links positioned at the footer. 

To maintain the simple and easy to consume aspect of the website, I avoided overcrowding of information and allowed pictures to do the explanations. If desired, employers click on the hyperlink on the about me page which will links them to a downloadable PDF version of my CV to find out more.


## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap (4.3)
* Javascript

## Features
1. Hover effect implemented on navigation bar and call to action button.
2. Logo redirects to Homepage (index.html) upon clicking.
3. About me redirects to about page (about.html) upon clicking.
4. Skill and Projects directs to anchor points on (index.html) upon clicking.
5. Use of transparent text, background image and position fixed to create image behind text scrolling effect.
6. Neumorphism cards are implemented through the use of white and black box shadows. 
7. Hover over the Neumorphism cards will reverse the shadows, giving it a "pushed-in" effect.
8. In Gallery section, use of display block, inline-block and hover transform to create mobile responsive and hover out effect.
9. Responsive to mobile IOS and Android device.
10. Page footer has social media links.
11. About me page allows employers to download my CV, get info on my contact. 

## Features Left to Implement
* I would like to implement javascript for a "coin" effect on the logo. Add more animation for image floating in upon scroll, change the navigation bar to a hamburger, include the PDF file of my CV into the website.
* For functionality, I would add a section for employers to write and send an email to me directly from the website itself. 

## Testing
Employers will be able to view my video the instance they enter the webpage. 

All links have been tested to ensure correct re-direction to desired destination.
1. Logo -> `about.html`
2. Project -> `index.html#projects`
3. Skills -> `index.html#skills`
4. Contact -> `about.html#contact`
5. Facebook -> `My Facebook profile`
6. Twitter -> `My Twitter Profile`
7. Instagram -> `My Instagram Profile`
8. LinkedIn -> `My linkedIn Profile`
9. Github -> `My Github Profile`
10. Download CV -> `#`  (not linked)

Upon clicking `Contact`, user will be re-directed to about me page, anchor at contact.

To ensure compatibility and responsiveness, the site was tested across multiple browsers such as Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer and on multiple android devices - Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL and iOS devices - iPhone 5-X, iPad and iPad Pro.

Upon testing, the use of webkit for text transparent of the Home page was not compatible with Internet Explorer.
